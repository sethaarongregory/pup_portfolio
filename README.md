# Portfolio for PUP Application

## Projects below include:

### (1) Analyzing YouTube Thumbnails Using Machine Learning
As an introduction to the computer science honors program, I had to perform an independent research project with several classmates on a topic of our choosing. While we all contributed an equal amount to this project, as the person with the most prior machine learning and math experience I took on somewhat of a leadership role in coming up with the project topic and giving the other members an introduction to machine learning through Keras, OpenCV, and some math background.

### (2) Predicting Heart Disease
Final project in data science course, on an individually chosen and researched topic. I used pandas and scikitlearn to examine the performance of several machine learning models on predicting the presence of heart disease in patients.

### (3) An Introduction to Quaternions with Applications in Transformations
Quaternions are an extension of complex numbers often utilized in aerospace engineering, computer graphics, and computer vision, among other fields, to simplify the manipulation of objects in 3D space and transformations of such objects. My project intends to give a brief introduction into the concept, including some background in basic linear algebra.

### (4) Transformers Animated Megatron 3-D Model Design & Toy Prototype
Designed and created 3D printed toy prototype of character Megatron based on a cancelled prototype from the Transformers Animated cartoon. Photos in this folder include the only released picture of the original prototype as designed by Hasbro, followed by the custom design and photos of the printed prototype. Figure transforms into jet mode and tank mode!
